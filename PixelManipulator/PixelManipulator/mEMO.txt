some Lines about this project.
First. We need to consider some stuff.
We were able to load the image onto the PictureField.
also, the loaded picture was a png. and when we checked the color of 1 pixel, we saw that it had
a alpha property in it. I wonder what happens if we try to load an png which has some serious alpha values in it.

- test pixels after loading a low alpha png file.
TEST OK

next thing. I am thinking about how we should handle the pixeldata. clearly there should be some kind of
class which we could use to build objects which we could use to handle the pixeldata.
we could call this class "pixelcontroller".

what kind of things do we want to do with this pixelcontroller thing?
- load in pixelinformation (argb) from pngs. the pixelinformation should be saved in a 1d array. so we can loop through them in an easy way.
	NOTE: pixels with a alpha value of 0 do not need to be stored since they are invisible and therefore irrelevant
	ARRAY contains:
		color: Color
		goalpos: point
		startpos: point
		currentpos: point
- there should be an update position method in which we are iterating through the pixels.
- there should be a thing which translates the pixelpositions back to a bitmap which we can draw on the pictureBox


so what now. we got that pixelinformation nicely saved in an array.
we want to move the pixels. the saved pixelinformation is something like the goalpos for each pixel. that makes sense.
